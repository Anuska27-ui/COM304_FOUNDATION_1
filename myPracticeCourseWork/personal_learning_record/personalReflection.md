**NOTE**

* At the conclusion of the module, describe how you have progressed.

The Raspberry Pi and its applications were completely new to me and also Github. I learned how to set it up, utilize it for various exercises and use technologies like Node-RED to perform IoT and automation tasks. I had no idea what github was and how to use but the module has helped me learn a lot about it.

I already had a basic understanding of networking, cloud computing and internet history; however the module expanded my knowledge, particularly in terms of practical use.

The practical tasks with Raspberry Pi brought me to real-world scenarios which helped me increase my technical confidence and capacity for problem solving.

Surprisingly there was nothing I struggled with during this module. While most of the subject, particularly the Raspberry Pi and Node-RED tasks, was new, the lectures were organized in such a way that everything was clear and simple to understand. The guidance provided by the professor was really helpful and that made the learning process smooth.

I have done a lot of online research to expand my knowledge which I have included in the notes. I also looked up articles and videos about Raspberry Pi to see how others were using the technology which encouraged me to think creatively.

I am going to explore more on the topics we covered in this module to expand my further knowledge. I am going to learn more about advanced cloud computing principles and networking through online tutorials and other resources.

Overall this module has helped me gain a lot of knowledge about computing, especially with the Raspberry Pi and related tools. Although most of the topics we covered were new to me, the well-structured lectures and exercises made learning easy and entertaining. I am confident in my abilities to expand on this foundation and ready to use my skills in future work.
