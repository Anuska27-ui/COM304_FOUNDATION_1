## session 1

In our first session we went through a short history about computing. We started our session by making an account on github and learned some basic stuff about github on how to use it as we will be using it for our module. We also took a look at the history of computing and I personally did some research on some of the topics and found more information. Below are the topics I researched :

**Mechanical Calculators and Mechanical Computers** - They are devices which use mechanical components like gears, levers and wheels to do calculations instead of electronic circuitry. These machines were used before there were any electronic calculators and computers. <https://www.quora.com/profile/Fitness-200>

**Key points in the material / reference-**

Mechanical calculators and computers use devices like gears, levers and wheels to perform calculations.

I chose this reference and I think it's a good reference because the explanation is simple and clear which allows beginners to understand difficult concepts about mechanical calculators and computers.

**Analogue computers and digital computers** - Analogue computers process data using a continuous signal. And digital computers are defined as one that operates with a single signal.

<https://byjus.com/govt-exams/difference-between-analog-and-digital-computers/>.

**Key points in the material / reference -**

Analogue computers use continuous signals to process data.

Digital computers operate with discrete signals (binary system).

The reference I used is a trusted educational platform with well - structured content that has clear definitions of analogue and digital computers which I found very useful.

**Computer languages** like Python, JavaScript are the essential programming languages which are used in web development, data science and enterprise software. <https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article>.

**Key points in the material / reference -**

Importance of programming languages in modern technology.

The reference provides a lot of information about programming languages and it helped me gain basic knowledge about different programming languages.

I will begin breaking down the project tasks into smaller milestones in GitHub’s project plan to stay on track with my progress.


## session 2

We started this session with an overview of computer architectures and then we dived into how boolean logic implemented in logic gates can be used to do binary arithmetic. We also did some exercises in the session and looked at the examples of binary arithmetic and boolean algebra and discussed how to clone and merge a repository using Git. Below I will talk about what I learned in this session.

Overview of Computer Architecture -

It is a backbone of computer science and is one of the most investigated areas of computing. It refers to the structure and operation of a computer system formed from its components.

Binary Arithmetic -

Binary numbers are essential for computing.

In order to represent negative values, binary addition and subtraction use 2s complement arithmetic.

Binary and Hexadecimal Number Representation -

Binary numbers are represented in hexadecimal to make them more human - readable.

The conversion between binary, decimal and hexadecimal has been explained through examples.

Binary Multiplication and Division -

Multiplication uses shift-and-add methods, whereas division uses repeated subtraction or shifting.

Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates -

I learned the basics of logic gates which are AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND.

Logic gates are the building blocks of computing devices like adders and flip-flops.

Creating and Programming a CPU -

A CPU is a component made up of components like registers, flip-flops and adders.

I learned how to program a simple 4-bit CPU with instructions stored in ROM.

Key learning points from the lecturer material -

Github usage - learned to clone and merge repositories.

Computer architecture - backbone of computer science.

Binary Arithmetic - fundamental operations like add, subtract, multiply and division in binary along with the understanding of 2s complement.

Boolean algebra and logic gates - basic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND) and their role in computing.

We also did some exercises and practised conversions using online hex calculators and games like the HEX game.

I also did some personal research online and below I will provide evidence and some information I found online.

Intel 4004 - Early CPU architecture insights also the first commercially available microprocessor. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004>

I watched a step-by-step guide to understand and gain more knowledge about 2s complement arithmetic. <https://tomfinley.com/>

Why are these good references?

They provide historical and practical context of the topic covered in the session. They also provide detailed explanations and visual aids to reinforce learning.

To expand my knowledge more on these topics I covered in this session , I will watch more practice videos and tutorials online. I will try to find books as well to help me learn more.



## session 3

In this session we explored how a CPU could be constructed using logic gates. Also we looked into practical understanding and how raspberry pi works in the outside world. We started off by installing nodeRed in raspberry pi by following the instructions from the notes in the session. Below I will talk about what I learned from the session and the key points from the lecturer material.

System on a Chip ( Soc )

The Raspberry Pi 3 uses the Broadcom BCM2837 SoC, which combines multiple important components.

GPIO overview

The GPIO pins which are accessed through a 40-pin connector can be programmed as either INPUT or OUTPUT.

NODE-RED and WiringPi

Node-Red : It is a low code visual programming tool for IoT and GPIO manipulation.

WiringPi : A library that simplifies GPIO programming for the Raspberry Pi.

Practical work -

We created and automated traffic lights sequences using breadboards, LEDs and GPIO pins. Node-red flows and the WiringPi library.

I also did some research personally to gain more knowledge about the following topic. Below I will link the resource I found online.

GPIO programming on Raspberry Pi - provides a physical link between the raspberry pi and external electronic components.

<https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/1>

This reference provides a clear, beginner friendly instruction on physical computing with the raspberry pi including step by step instructions and examples.

I am going to do more research to expand my knowledge in these topics. I’m going to look through tutorial videos. Also books like Raspberry Pi Cookbook might help as well.


## session 4 (consolidate)

In this session we focused on consolidating the knowledge gained in the past sessions, organizing it into structured notes for future references and reinforcing essential concepts.
