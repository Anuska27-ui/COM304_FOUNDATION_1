## session 9

In this we focused on understanding how computer networking works including the fundamental ideas of networking and how devices connect over the internet. Below I will talk about some points we covered in the session.

Networking overview

Data transmission -

Modern networks use the Internet Protocol to break data into packets which are transmitted individually and reassembled at once.

Networks components -

Computers (hosts, servers and workstation are network endpoints that consume or generate traffic.

Routers are devices that use routing tables to forward packets to their desired destinations.

There are also other topics we covered which are Network protocol layers, connecting to a RaspberryPi remotely using a SSH with the tools like putty which allows secure terminal access to the Pi. And then I did some practical networking exercises.

Key points -

Networking is the process of breaking down communication into manageable layers each with its own set of protocols and responsibilities.

Practical tools and exercises ( such as routing table management and remote access settings ) helped me improve my understanding and capability in managing small networks.

I used RaspberryPi for practical networking practice which is an ideal tool that supports both command-line and graphical user interface.

In my spare time I will go through online platforms of raspberry pi and watch tutorials to expand my further knowledge.



## session 10

In this session we went through the brief history of the internet and cloud computing. After that we explored the basics of creating and navigating an azure cloud account. I did some research on the topic we covered , below I will cover some main points from the resources I found.

The internet began as ARPANET , a US department of defense experiment to build an open communication network.

Their key invention is packet switching which allows data to be split down into smaller packets and sent more effectively.

Around the 1980s ARPANET expanded beyond military and academic applications.

And in the 1990s Tim Berners-Lee designed the world wide web which included web browsers and HTML.

2000s and beyond , social networking, e-commerce and mobile creativity brought the internet into the mainstream and with that the rise of computing, streaming and IoT has changed the consumption. <https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/short-history-internet>

This resource helped gain more information about the internet's history. It provides a well - structured of the internetâ€™s evolution from aparnet to modern developments.

I have also found books online. I am going to go through the books and other online resources to expand my knowledge in this topic.


## session 11 and 12 (consolidate)

These two sessions we reviewed all the previous sessions to identify incomplete exercises or concepts requiring clarifications.
