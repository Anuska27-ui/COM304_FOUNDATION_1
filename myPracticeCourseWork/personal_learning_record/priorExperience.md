# Prior Experience

**NOTE**

* Describe your past experience of computing.
  
I did a BTEC course in IT with level 1 , 2 and 3.1 ( foundation year). The course has helped me learn a lot about different areas in IT and it helped me develop a strong understanding in the IT field. I have learned basic stuff about programming and databases. I can do simple programs in python and I also know how to store, manage and organise the data in a database.  These experiences have helped me gain some basic knowledge about computing and programming. 

* What do you know and what would you like to learn from this module?
  
Right now I just have some basic knowledge of computing from my previous course. I know how to do simple coding in python and how to do some basic databases and Iâ€™m also familiar with general concepts of IT like networking, hardware and software.

From this module I would like to gain more knowledge and understanding of core computing topics. I want to learn more about programming, especially how to write more complex code and solve real-world problems. I would like to improve my computing skills and understanding on how computing technologies are used in different industries. I hope this module will help me develop more practical skills and prepare me for the future and a career in IT.
